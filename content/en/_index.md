This summer (2025), I read **Bill Gates' book, *Source Code***, as well as a magazine dedicated to the retro computers of my youth.

These readings inspired me, and I wanted to dive back into the era by developing a **BASIC interpreter inspired by the Altair**.

My goal: achieve the lowest possible memory and CPU footprint.
Not being entirely masochistic 😄, I didn't start from assembly code, but rather from a **C program**, avoiding standard libraries to keep the memory footprint minimal.

For this project, I relied on the **ChatGPT AI**, via the web.
It helped me to:
- think through the code architecture (roles and responsibilities),
- redefine basic functions (`printf`, `strcpy`, etc.) to avoid standard libraries,
- assist in developing some of the more complex parts.

## Towards a Real 8-Bit Machine

Emboldened by this experience, I wanted to take it further: **develop an application for a period computer**.

On various forums, I had seen enthusiasts coding in C for the **Commodore 64**, using a Windows development setup.
So I went on a quest to buy one on Le Bon Coin… but:
- the prices were insane,
- it was impossible to verify proper functioning remotely (no photos of it powered on, screen connected, etc.).

Then I stumbled upon **an ad for a Thomson MO5**: real keyboard (not rubber keys), cassette drive, light pen, all for **€80, just 30 minutes away**.
**Sold!** 🎉 And that's how this adventure began.

## The MO5, Really?

Online resources for the MO5 are more limited than for the Commodore, but with the rise of AI, I figured it could become **a tremendous asset** to help me develop (I'm counting on some serious coding vibes, maybe a bit too much… 😄).

I also know that **the more context an AI has, the more accurate and effective it becomes**.
So my project has a dual goal:
1. Create an **application for the Thomson MO5**, with the help of AI.
2. Provide **documentation and technical context** that AIs can use, allowing other budding developers to dive in as well.

In short, an adventure at the crossroads of past and future:
**bringing a 1984 machine back to life using 2025 tools.** 🚀
## My adventure starts here...
