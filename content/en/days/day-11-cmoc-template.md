# Creating a MO5 template to stop fighting the build

Lately, I had **way too many topics open at the same time**.

Way too many 😅

In no particular order, there were:

* continuing my experiments to better understand how **graphics mode works on the MO5**
* completing the **documentation of my RAG server**
* modifying that RAG server to **simplify keyword management**, then redeploying it with the new documentation
* **hosting my MCP server**
* building a **small graphics-mode game** on the MO5

And in the middle of all that, a very down-to-earth problem kept coming back:

> every new MO5 project made me lose time reconfiguring the build, the tools, and the floppy disk conversions.

That’s how the idea of creating a **MO5 project template** was born.

## Graphics on the MO5… from emulator to real hardware

For my graphics experiments, I naturally started with **DCMOTO**.

Fast, convenient, perfect for iterating.

But as soon as I wanted to move to a **real MO5**, an important hardware reality hit me:

* the emulator works with **.fd** (floppy disk) files
* **SDDRIVE** expects **.sd** files on the SD card

Which means you can’t test directly without a conversion step.

---

## The .fd → .sd conversion: the little grain of sand

There *is* an existing utility (a Windows `.exe`) to convert `.fd` files into `.sd`.

But in my case, it was **far from ideal**:

* not integrated into the build
* OS-dependent
* yet another manual step

In short, exactly the kind of thing I wanted to **automate away**.

So I went back to the sources and wrote **a Python script** responsible for handling the conversion.

Instead of copying it everywhere, I integrated it directly into my **MO5 SDK**, so there would be **a single source of truth**.

---

## The template idea

At that point, I thought:

> “If I have to redo this for every new project, I’m going to lose my mind.”

What I needed was a **template** that takes care of all the boring parts.

A base project that:

* automatically fetches Olivier P’s repository to generate `.fd` files
* fetches my **MO5 SDK**, compiles it, and produces a `.a` static library plus headers
* correctly configures the **cmoc** command line (includes + library)
* compiles the user project
* generates a `.fd` file for emulator testing
* generates a `.sd` file to test directly on a real MO5 using SDDRIVE

In other words: **I write code, I run `make`, and it works**.

---

## GitHub + templates = ❤️

GitHub offers a simple but perfect feature for this: **repository templates**.

Exactly what I needed.

Let’s be honest:

* this template is intentionally simple
* it’s basically a **Makefile** and an example `main.c`

But it lays down **all the foundations** to start a MO5 project without wasting an hour on configuration.

So I created the template and published it on GitHub:

## How to use it

Nothing fancy.

On GitHub:

1. go to the template repository
2. click **"Use this template"**
3. create a new repository
4. start coding 🎉

Everything else is handled by the Makefile.

---

## What’s next?

This template will become my **foundation** for:

* continuing my graphics experiments on the MO5
* developing a small game
* testing quickly on both emulator **and** real hardware

And most importantly:

> stop wasting time on the build and focus on the fun.

Enjoy 👋
