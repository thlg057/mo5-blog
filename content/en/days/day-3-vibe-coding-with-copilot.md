For this vibe coding session, I decided to test **Copilot Pro**, taking advantage of the few **free trial days**.
And to put all the chances on my side, I started directly from **Olivier P’s** repository:
👉 *OlivierP-To8/BootFloppyDisk*

---

## My objective

With ChatGPT, I hadn’t managed to create my own code nor to use Olivier’s project to generate a working disk image for the MO5.
Yet, in theory, everything seemed simple:
I take **the same source**, copy it into my repo, compile it, use Olivier’s tools… no reason for it to break.

---

## First success

That’s exactly what I asked Copilot to do:
retrieve Olivier’s example, compile it, then generate the disk image.

And then… a technological miracle: **it worked on the first try**.

Copilot struggled a bit to replace the text from Olivier’s sample, but after a few attempts, it finally succeeded. A first, very motivating win!

---

## Second objective: handling keyboard input

Right after that, I jumped into a more interactive test.

The idea was simple:

1. display *“What is your name?”*
2. allow the user to type their name
3. display *“Hello <name>”*

And that’s exactly where things started to get complicated…

---

## Where everything got stuck

After several iterations, Copilot managed to:

- correctly display messages
- capture keyboard input
- store the result in a buffer
- confirm in debug that the characters were properly stored

But **it was impossible to display the name**.
After *“Hello “*, the screen stubbornly remained empty.

I could type a name, I could verify it was in memory… but the display simply refused to show it.

---

## Copilot’s final analysis

After a few hours circling around the problem, I asked it to generate a summary.
Here is what came out of it.

---

### ✔️ What worked

- display of static messages
- keyboard input with echo
- correct storage in the buffer
- debug verification: the buffer does contain the entered characters

### ❌ What didn’t work

- the buffer display loop after *“Hello “*

## 🔬 The critical discovery

By going as far as analyzing the source code of the **Maurice** emulator (written in Rust), Copilot discovered that it only supports:

- K7 cassette reading
- K7 cassette writing
- motor control
- light pen

And most importantly:

> Standard SWI calls `$02` (PUTCHAR) and `$0A` (GETCHAR) **are not implemented** in the emulator.

Which explains why the system display routines produced absolutely nothing.

---

## 🔧 Attempted solutions (unsuccessful)

- standard SWI (`swi` + `fcb $02`)
- direct calls to ROM routines (`jsr $D52D`)
- addresses supposedly intercepted by the emulator (`jsr $F1B0`)
- CWAI approach (blocks the program)
- direct reading of I/O ports

All of them led to the same result:
**the name never displayed**.

---

## 🎯 Copilot’s conclusion

According to Copilot, the bug most likely came from **DCMOTO / Maurice**, not from the assembly code itself.
It even recommended testing the program on a **real Thomson MO5**, which would confirm that the issue lies in the emulator.

---

## Wrap-up

A bit disappointed with the result: the request seemed simple, almost “basic”, and yet…
Without a fully compatible emulator, some features become simply impossible to validate.

So it was time to try **another development agent**…

To be continued. 🚀
