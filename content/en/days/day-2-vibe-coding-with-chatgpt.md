For my first day, I chose to start with **ChatGPT**.  
Admittedly, it’s a general-purpose AI and not one specialized in software development, but I figured it would be a good starting point.

---

## My goal

I had a fairly clear idea: **develop a small game in C**.  
I had also read that for anything related to graphics, it was better to use assembly language.  
So I planned to rely on ChatGPT to guide me through that language. 😉

I then wanted to **test the program in an emulator**.

---

## First attempts

I started by explaining my context and needs, then asked for useful references.  
ChatGPT listed several blogs and tools… but most of them **no longer existed**: deleted repositories, moved links, unknown or unreachable tools.

On the code side, things got complicated:
- The first proposals **didn’t compile**, mainly due to obsolete compiler options.
- ChatGPT suggested code using `stdio.h` and `putchar`, even though **I couldn’t use external libraries** in this context.
- After several back-and-forth exchanges, I finally obtained **code that compiled**.
- All that remained was to **run it in the emulator**…

## The `.k7` nightmare

ChatGPT became convinced that it could generate a `.k7` file using the `-k7` option of `cmoc`, which **doesn’t exist (or no longer does)**.  
Then it pointed me to **buildcass** (vanished repo: [columboo/buildcass](https://github.com/columboo/buildcass.git)) and then **lwbin2tap**, which I never managed to find.

As a fallback, it suggested writing a **Python script** to convert a `.bin` file into a `.k7`.  
We tested several versions, but **none of them worked**: in **dcmoto**, the message “rewind the tape” kept appearing over and over.

I tried loading the `.bin` file directly into dcmoto, but nothing worked either: the `LOAD`, `EXEC`, etc. commands produced no result.

## A glimmer of hope… then another dead end

After some research, I came across **Olivier P’s** repository:  
👉 [OlivierP-To8/BootFloppyDisk](https://github.com/OlivierP-To8/BootFloppyDisk)

I asked ChatGPT to take inspiration from it to generate a small *“Hello world”* program in assembly.  
But once again, **the program didn’t work**.

---

## End-of-day thoughts

A bit frustrating, I admit.  
Everything seemed promising: the discussions with ChatGPT were interesting, ideas were plentiful, examples were detailed (even a mini-game!)… but **nothing actually runnable** in the end.

The references were **out of date**, the AI seemed to **lose track of the context**, and sometimes even **go in circles**.

So it was time to **move on to an AI dedicated to development**. 🚀
