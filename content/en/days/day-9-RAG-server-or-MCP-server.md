In the previous episodes, I talked about my RAG server, why it exists and how it helps me provide context to AIs.  
But as my experiments progressed, I realized an important point:

**a RAG server, no matter how well built it is, is not sufficient for a smooth and robust integration with modern AIs**.  
There is a missing building block to connect coding agents to my RAG server.

In this article, I will explain:
- what a **RAG server** is,  
- what a **MCP server** is,  
- why RAG alone is not enough,  
- and how I plan to evolve my RAG server so it can be used via MCP.

## 🧠 RAG: what is it?

A **RAG server** (*Retrieval-Augmented Generation*) has a simple and powerful goal:

> **augment an AI model with relevant external context.**

Concretely, it combines:
- a knowledge base (documents, notes, `.md` files),
- a semantic search engine (vectors, embeddings),
- potentially AI services that rebuild enriched prompts.

When an AI receives a question, the RAG will:
1. search the knowledge base for the most relevant text fragments,
2. return those fragments to be included in the prompt,
3. improve the final quality of the answer.

A RAG server is therefore essentially an **augmented search backend**, able to answer requests such as:

```
POST /api/search
```

with a semantic query, tags, and a list of results.

👉 The goal is to provide **textual context**, not to manage the AI itself.

## 🔌 MCP: it is not an engine, it is an **interface**

A **MCP server** (*Model Context Protocol*) is not another way of doing document search.  
It is a **standard interface** that allows an AI, or a software agent, to *discover and call external capabilities* in a uniform way.

Concretely, with MCP a server exposes:
- **tools**
- **resources**
- **prompts**

and each element is described with a clear schema (input/output), so that an AI can:
- know what is available,
- how to call it,
- which inputs to expect.

👉 MCP is a **semantic abstraction layer** on top of classic APIs. It is a standard way of telling an AI:

> *Here is what I can do, and how you can use it.*

Without MCP, an AI does not know how to call your RAG API, which routes exist, or how to format the expected JSON payloads.

## ❗ Why a RAG server alone is not enough

During my experiments, especially when testing Augment or other AI agents, I noticed that:
- AIs **hallucinate** or reinvent the wheel if they are not given explicit context,
- each AI or agent has its own way of consuming APIs,
- **without a standard protocol**, you end up writing specific code bridges for each client,
- you lose portability and maintainability.

In other words:

> The RAG provides context.  
>  
> The MCP tells the AI how to **find and use** that context.

Without MCP, even the best RAG becomes almost useless for intelligent agents that want to automate their usage.

## 🛠️ What I am going to do

Rather than creating a dedicated MCP server, I chose a more pragmatic approach:

> **add MCP endpoints directly to my existing RAG server**.

The idea is simple:
1. my RAG server continues to exist as before (embeddings, semantic search, ingestion),
2. I add a standard **MCP interface** on top of it,
3. the AI (Claude, Cursor, Augment or others) can *discover* the tools and call them automatically.

Concretely, this means adding at least:
- a `GET /mcp` route that describes the server,
- a `GET /mcp/tools` route that lists the available tools,
- `POST /mcp/tools/{toolName}` routes to execute semantic searches from any MCP client,
- MCP resources (documents, tags, ingestion status),
- potentially prompts to guide the AI (for example an “expert assistant” role).

This evolution does not break anything that already exists, but **opens the server to generalized automated usage**.

## 🧩 Summary

| Concept | Role |
|--------|------|
| **RAG** | Provides relevant *textual context* to an AI |
| **MCP** | Provides a *standard interface* so AIs can easily use that context |

👉 A RAG without MCP is useful but limited.  
👉 An MCP without RAG is an empty interface.  
👉 **The combination of both is what makes a server truly relevant for modern AI systems.**

In the coming days, I will document the MCP implementation of my server, the added endpoints, and how to test everything with different AI agents.

Stay tuned! 🚀
