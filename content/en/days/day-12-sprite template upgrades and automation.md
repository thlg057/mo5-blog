On this new day of **MO5 coding**, I did quite a lot of things, and especially a lot of experiments around graphics mode.

## Generating sprites from images

I tackled a fairly classic problem: **drawing sprites in C for the MO5** is… how can I put it… not the most fun thing 😅

At first, I went for a very “handcrafted” approach: drawing in text mode via Notepad, with a space for the background color, an `X` to draw the shape color, then using a PowerShell script to transform the text into a bit array.

Honestly, it worked pretty well for simple shapes.  
But as soon as you want to do something a bit more detailed… it quickly becomes tedious and not very practical.

So I thought:  
> Why not start directly from an image?

The idea: analyze an image and convert it into a **usable C structure** in my program.

To do that, I once again used a PowerShell script to transform the image into a C structure. Concretely, the generated structure is a **bit array**, where each bit represents a pixel.

And on this one, **Claude.io** really helped me with the image analysis + conversion part.

I am quite proud of the result, of course the script could be improved, but honestly, it does the job well.
It also takes MO5 constraints into account: 2 colors (background and shape) for 8 pixels.

## Integration into my SDK

Since I wanted to avoid copying this script into all my projects, I integrated it directly into my mo5_sdk project (https://github.com/thlg057/sdk_mo5).

Then, since this SDK is used by my template (https://github.com/thlg057/mo5_template), I just needed to add a **`convert` target in the Makefile**.

Result:
- I drop an image into the project,  
- I run `make convert` specifying the name,  
- it automatically generates the corresponding `.h`.

Pretty convenient 👌

Obviously, I also modified the SDK to add the functions required to display the generated sprite (mo5_sprit.h/.c).

And overall… it works pretty well 😉

## Tests in GitHub Codespaces

Next, I wanted to test my template in a clean environment.

Off to: **GitHub Codespaces**.

And honestly: great experience. I had never used it before, and I was quite blown away by this environment, simple but frightfully effective.

I just had to install cmoc, python, and that was it, it worked (almost on the first try).

It mainly allowed me to:
- validate that my template is portable,  
- debug 2–3 things in the SDK,  
- verify that onboarding is simple.

## YouTube video idea

So I think I’m going to make a video to show:
- how to configure the MO5 environment,  
- how to use the template,  
- how to make a first graphics program,  
- all directly inside a GitHub Codespace.

I think it could help quite a few people get started without struggling with local setup.

## Documentation & VPS scripts

At the same time, I also worked on other topics.

### Improving MO5 documentation

I kept improving the Markdown documentation:
- clarifications,  
- examples,  
- cleaner structure.

It’s not the most fun part, but it’s essential.

### VPS update script

I also wrote a PowerShell script to manage updates for my VPS hosting my **RAG**.

The repo contains no credentials, but I still didn’t make it public, for obvious security reasons.

I took the opportunity to:
- add **security headers**,  
- aim for an **A** grade on securityheaders.com,  
- automate deployment.

And now the script can:
- deploy to my VPS,  
- or locally to my NAS.

Honestly, it simplifies my life quite a bit.

## Next steps

Short term:

➡️ Make a video showing how to create a first MO5 graphics program in GitHub Codespaces.

Then I think I’ll move on to something more fun:

🎮 **Programming a game in vibe coding**

With one idea in mind: linking Augment to my MCP server.

I’m curious to see how far I can push the workflow and vibe coding with the right context.

Another very full day.

A lot of tooling, less “visible”… but solid foundations for what comes next 🚀
