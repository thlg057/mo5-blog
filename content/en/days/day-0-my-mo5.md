After failing to find a Commodore 64 at an affordable price, I broadened my search to other 1980s 8-bit machines.

On Le Bon Coin, I came across an ad: **"Selling my childhood MO5, with cassette drive, games, and a light pen"**, fully working, located 40 km from my home.

It was quite a good deal: first owner (the seller had received it for his first communion) and some room for negotiation. I finally got everything for **€80**. For that price, I even received the warranty certificate. Given the age of the computer, I doubt it would still be usable in case of a breakdown.

## The display

The MO5 video output uses a SCART connector.
I did not want to use SCART → HDMI converters, which I consider unreliable and potentially introducing latency.

So I looked for a monitor or TV with a native SCART input. Luckily, I found one very quickly on Le Bon Coin for **€20**.

It is a **24-inch Samsung TV/monitor**, with every input imaginable, perfectly suited to my project. The cherry on top: it was only 10 km from my home.

## Programming the MO5

Since I plan to develop software for this MO5, I needed a way to load my programs onto it.
I discovered software that can convert a binary program into a WAV file, which can then be "played" through a simple connection (phone audio jack output → MO5 audio input). A bit hacky, but sufficient to get started.

In the meantime, I discovered a forum of enthusiasts: [forum.system-cfg.com](https://forum.system-cfg.com).
They offer DIY electronic projects, including one that simulates a floppy disk drive using an SD card. I have some experience in electronics and soldering, but my eyesight is no longer ideal for very precise soldering.

So I opted for a **pre-assembled kit**, delivered for **€39** ([link to the kit](https://forum.system-cfg.com/viewtopic.php?t=9196)).
This component simulates a floppy disk drive: all that remains is to copy the files onto an SD card.

I must admit I hesitated before ordering: payment is done via PayPal Friends & Family (no recourse in case of non-delivery), and you have to provide your address in a comment. Days went by… no news… and suddenly, the package was in my mailbox. Perfect!

## Joysticks

I did not have a joystick controller and wanted to play using the keyboard, but it was less fun.

On Le Bon Coin, nothing was available for under €60. €60 for a joystick when the MO5 cost me €80 felt expensive.

Looking more closely on [forum.system-cfg.com](https://forum.system-cfg.com), I found an article explaining how to build an interface for two joysticks. As with the SDDRIVE, I chose the **pre-assembled option for €14.20**, shipping included.

For the joystick itself, I specifically looked for a **Thomson** model and found what I needed on Le Bon Coin: **€9.98**, shipping included.

I am now ready to test my developments on the MO5!

## What I spent (September 2025)

| Equipment | Price |
|-----------|-------|
| MO5 | €80 |
| TV with SCART | €20 |
| SDDRIVE pack + Minibus + shipping | €39 |
| Joystick controller | €14.20 |
| Joystick | €9.98 |
| **Total** | **€163.18** |

Before adding everything up, I didn’t feel like I had spent that much… I hope my project will be worth it!
