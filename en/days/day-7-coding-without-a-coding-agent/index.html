seven of vibe coding: AI doesn’t know everything 😢","keywords":["AI","MO5","Assembly","Retro"],"articleBody":"After my experiments with Augment, I had an idea in mind for a few days.\nCreate my own C library to make development on the MO5 easier.\nNothing huge.\nJust something to avoid rewriting the same bits of code over and over again.\nAugment had already generated a few utility functions.\nBut the ones that felt truly fundamental to me were these:\nchar mo5_getchar(void) { asm { swi fcb $0A } } void mo5_putchar(char c) { asm { ldb c swi fcb $02 } } In my head, everything started from there.\nThose two functions as a base, and then rebuilding the rest around them.\nI set myself a simple goal: a “light” / simplified version of:\nmo5_stdio mo5_ctype mo5_string A solid foundation to start with.\nBack to the old-school way For this mission, there was no way I could rely on Augment.\nI had burned all my credits the previous weekend while developing my RAG server.\nNothing left.\nSo no choice: code the old-school way\ntype the code by hand think mess up fix repeat I reused what Augment had already provided and started implementing my libraries one by one.\nEach time, I tested them in a small test project running in the DCMOTO emulator.\nThings were moving forward pretty well… well… almost…\ngetchar(), my first wall I wanted to wrap mo5_getchar() into a cleaner getchar().\nOn paper, it looked trivial.\nIn practice: corrupted buffers, weird characters, inconsistent behavior.\nIn short, it smelled bad.\nAfter a while, I gave up and went for the simplest solution:\n#define getchar mo5_getchar It’s not pretty… but it works…\nPride… then discomfort Once my libraries were functional, I was quite happy with the result.\nHappy enough to start writing a few small tutorials to show them in action, and even to imagine the content of my next article, about how I had single-handedly managed to provide the community with THE essential libraries for the MO5!\nBut while coding, one thought kept coming back:\nIt’s still strange to have to rewrite these basic functions…\nDuring my first searches about C development on the MO5, I had only found examples:\nin BASIC in assembly Not really any C examples.\nStill… something felt off…\nIt felt like too much…\ncmoc, the silent traitor I went digging into the installation directory of cmoc.\nAnd there… surprise!\nInside cmoc/include, I found several .h files.\nNo stdio.h, no ctype.h, no string.h.\nBut one file stood out: cmoc.h.\nI opened it… and then… smack.\nMany of the functions I had painfully rewritten were already there:\nputchar memset strcmp memcpy strlen isprint and even printf 😑\nSo I tried simply including:\n#include A few tests later, the verdict was clear:\nmy homemade libraries had become completely useless… redundant… obsolete before they even existed…\nBack to official functions I rewrote my samples using the functions provided by cmoc.\nAnd honestly… it’s much better this way.\nReinventing the wheel can be fun.\nBut when a wheel already exists, tested and documented, you might as well use it.\nThere’s still one thing missing though:\nI couldn’t find a real getchar().\nThere is readline(), but it waits for the user to press Enter.\nNo way to read a single character (for example: “Press Y to continue”).\nI also ran into a few instabilities when using printf(), but that most likely comes from my own code.\nLesson of the day I should have had this reflex from the start: a C developer checks the .h files first.\nThat’s the basics.\nI let myself be carried too much by the AI.\nIt answered my need, but without the right context, it preferred to rebuild everything instead of reusing what already existed.\nWhat I take away from this My first lesson was that vibe coding with AI is expensive (I spent my 40,000 credits in three half-days).\nThis experience brings me another lesson: without precise context, AI tends to reinvent the wheel (when it doesn’t hallucinate).\nFor classic developments, like .NET microservices, AI has very good context because it’s “standard” development.\nFor my MO5 project, which is clearly a niche project, it’s a very different story.\nYou therefore have to explicitly provide the context, and in detail.\nIf you don’t clearly tell the AI that something exists, it won’t find it: documentation is limited, sometimes nonexistent.\nParallel research is therefore essential in order to guide the AI properly.\nMy RAG server project makes even more sense now.\nI’ll be able to enrich it with this experience, so that next time, the AI can directly use the existing libraries.\nIn the end, running out of credits on Augment turned out to be a very good thing.\nIt forced me to investigate on my own and discover these “hidden” functions (or at least unknown to the AI… and to me).\nAnd ultimately, it allowed me to avoid reinventing the wheel.\nIn summary for Day 7:\nLess magic More reality And a good C developer slap 😉 The code associated with this article is available
